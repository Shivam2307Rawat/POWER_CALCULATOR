# ⚡ Power Calculator with Exception Handling

This project is a Java-based **Power Calculator** that computes `n^p` (n raised to the power p) while showcasing strong **exception handling** practices. It ensures users provide valid non-negative inputs and displays clear, meaningful error messages when invalid data is entered.


## ✨ Features

- 🧮 Calculates the power of two integers `n` and `p`.
  
- 🚫 Handles and throws exceptions for:
  
  - Negative values of `n` or `p`.
    
  - Both `n` and `p` being zero.
    
- 🔁 Supports multiple calculations in a single session.
  
- 🎯 Clear user prompts and error messages to guide user interaction.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java
  
- Scanner class for input
  
- **Custom Exception Handling**
  
  - `throw` and `throws` keywords
    
  - Try-catch blocks for managing runtime errors
