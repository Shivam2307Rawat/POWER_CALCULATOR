# POWER_CALCULATOR
This project implements a simple Power Calculator in Java that calculates n^p (n raised to the power p) with robust exception handling. It ensures users provide valid non-negative inputs and gracefully handles error scenarios through custom messages. The program is interactive and user-friendly for multiple calculations.
